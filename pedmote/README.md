#### Spawngen
This FiveM addon steals a lot of code from [dpemotes](https://github.com/andristum/dpemotes). 

This addon adds a new command `/spawn <name_of_ped> <dance>` which will spwan a new `ped` with the same name doing `<dance>` in the direction faced by the player. 

##### Installation:
1. Copy this directory to `<server-data>/resources/`
2. Add `ensure pedmotes` to your `server.cfg`
